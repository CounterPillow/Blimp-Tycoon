============

Introduction
------------
Blimp Tycoon (working title) is a tycoon game, in which the goal is to earn as
much money as possible by transporting cargo and passengers between floating
islands, with a steampunk-y setting. The games setting and art-style is
inspired by Unigine's "Heaven" benchmark, which features floating islands and
blimps.

Compiling
---------
To compile, you'll need BlitzMax ($80, http://www.blitzbasic.com).
You will also need the module minib3d, a 3d module for blitzmax,
available from https://github.com/si-design/minib3d.

ToDo
====
A lot.
