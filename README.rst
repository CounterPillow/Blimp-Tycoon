Blimp Tycoon
============

Warning: This is literally a 9 year old meme project. It has no value. The
only reason why this has received a commit this decade is because somebody
actually e-mailed me about it, which is extremely funny to me.

Yes it still builds. For whatever that's worth.

Introduction
------------
Blimp Tycoon (working title) is a tycoon game, in which the goal is to earn as
much money as possible by transporting cargo and passengers between floating
islands, with a steampunk-y setting. The games setting and art-style is
inspired by Unigine's "Heaven" benchmark, which features floating islands and
blimps.

Compiling
---------
To compile, you'll need BlitzMax (Free! https://blitzmax.org).
You will also need the module minib3d, a 3d module for blitzmax,
available from https://github.com/si-design/minib3d.

ToDo
====
A lot.
